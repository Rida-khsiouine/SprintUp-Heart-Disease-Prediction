# SprintUp-Heart-Disease-Prediction
🫀 Heart Disease Prediction – Comprehensive ML Pipeline
This project is the final output of the SprintUp - AI & Machine Learning Foundations training offered by Sprints. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a Machine Learning solution using the Heart Disease UCI dataset.

📌 Project Objective
Build a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline that can classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical and personal health data.

📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Features: 13 clinical attributes + target
Target: Presence or absence of heart disease (binary classification)
🚀 ML Pipeline Overview 🔹 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Handling missing values Encoding categorical variables Feature scaling and normalization

🔹 2. Dimensionality Reduction Applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce feature space and visualize data

🔹 3. Feature Selection Selected top features based on correlation and model-based techniques

🔹 4. Supervised Learning Trained and evaluated multiple classification models: Logistic Regression Decision Trees Random Forest SVM

🔹 5. Unsupervised Learning Clustered data using: K-Means Hierarchical Clustering

🔹 6. Hyperparameter Tuning Used GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV for model optimization

🔹 7. Model Export & Deployment Exported final model using pickle

📈 Evaluation Metrics Accuracy Precision Recall F1-score Confusion Matrix

🙏 Acknowledgments Sprints for offering the training program. UCI for the public dataset.

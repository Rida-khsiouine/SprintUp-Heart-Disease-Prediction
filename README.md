# SprintUp-Heart-Disease-Prediction
🫀 Heart Disease Prediction – Comprehensive ML Pipeline
This project is the final output of the SprintUp - AI & Machine Learning Foundations training by [Sprints](https://sprints.ai/), showcasing an end-to-end ML solution using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

🎯 Project Objective

Predict heart disease: classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical and personal health data.

📊 Dataset

[UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) – 13 clinical features + binary target (presence / absence of heart disease).

🚀 ML Pipeline Overview

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features.

Dimensionality Reduction: applied PCA to reduce feature space and visualize data.

Feature Selection: selected top features using correlation and model-based techniques.

Supervised Learning: trained Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM.

Unsupervised Learning: clustered data using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

Hyperparameter Tuning: optimized models with GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV.

Model Export & Deployment: exported final trained pipeline using pickle.

📈 Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
